Question: Difference between .NET Framework, .NET standard, Core.
Answer:
	The .NET Framework, .NET Standard, and .NET Core are all runtimes for building applications with .NET.
	They share many of the same APIs called the .NET Standard 1. Here are some differences between them:

.NET Framework: It is used for Windows desktop and server-based applications,
including ASP.NET web applications. It is dependent on the Windows operating system 
and does not support the development of standalone desktop applications.

.NET Standard: It is a compatibility API that was created to allow assemblies
(the .NET term for .dll files) to be compiled for either .NET Framework or .NET Core.
It replaces all different BCLs for all frameworks.

.NET Core: It is used for server applications that run on Windows, Linux, and Mac, and supports the implementation of microservices.
It is more effective, fast, secure, flexible, and scalable than .NET Framework and offers cross-platform performance and cloud deployment. 
It is open source and free to use and has community contributions.

Overall, .NET Core is more effective than .NET Framework in terms of performance and scalability.
It also offers cross-platform performance and cloud deployment. On the other hand, .NET Framework is used for Windows desktop and server-based applications
