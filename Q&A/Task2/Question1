Question: What is WEB API?
Ansewer:
	A Web API (Application Programming Interface) is an interface that allows different software applications
	to communicate with each other over the internet. It is a set of protocols and tools for building software 
	and applications. Web APIs can be used to access data from a database and save data back to the database.

	For example, if you are using a mobile app that requires data from a server,
	the app will send a request to the server through a Web API. 
	The server will then process the request and send back the requested data 
	in a format that can be easily understood by the app.
