Question: About HTTPS, HTTP vs HTTPS
Answer: 
	HTTP and HTTPS are both protocols that are used to transfer data between a client and a server.
	HTTP is the original protocol, while HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that uses encryption to
	protect data from being intercepted by third parties.

	The main difference between HTTP and HTTPS is that HTTPS uses SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) to encrypt all data 
	that is transferred between the client and the server. This means that any data that is sent, such as passwords, credit card numbers,
	or personal information, cannot be intercepted by third parties.

	HTTPS is the preferred protocol for websites that handle sensitive data, 
	such as e-commerce websites or any other site requiring users to log in using their credentials.
	This is because HTTPS provides a layer of security that helps to protect users' data from being intercepted and stolen.

	Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between HTTP and HTTPS:

	Feature 	HTTP							HTTPS
	Protocol	Hypertext Transfer Protocol		Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure
	Encryption	No								Yes, using SSL/TLS
	Security	Not secure						Secure
	Use cases	General use						Websites that handle sensitive data

	Here are some of the benefits of using HTTPS:

	Data security: HTTPS encrypts all data that is transferred between the client and the server, 
	which helps to protect users' data from being intercepted and stolen.
	Increased user trust: HTTPS gives users peace of mind knowing that their data is secure when they are using a website that uses HTTPS.
	This can lead to increased user trust and loyalty.
	Better SEO ranking: Google and other search engines often give websites that use HTTPS a higher ranking in search results. 
	This is because HTTPS is seen as a sign of trustworthiness and security.
	If you are running a website that handles sensitive data, I recommend that you switch to HTTPS.
	HTTPS is a simple and effective way to protect your users' data and improve your website's security.
