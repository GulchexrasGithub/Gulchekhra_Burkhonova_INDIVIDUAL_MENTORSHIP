Question: About Branching models (GitFlow, GitHub Flow, The Forking Workflow).
Answer:
	Branching models are strategies for managing branches and workflows within a Git repository.
	Here are explanations of three popular branching models:

	GitFlow:
	GitFlow is a branching model designed for projects with a more structured and 
	long-term development cycle. It separates development into different types of branches, each serving a specific purpose:
	Main Branches:

	master: Represents the production-ready code.
	develop: Serves as the integration branch for ongoing development.
	Supporting Branches:

	feature: Used for developing new features or enhancements. Created off develop and merged back into it.
	release: Prepares the code for a new release. Created off develop and merged into both develop and master.
	hotfix: Addresses critical issues in the production code. Created off master and merged back into both develop and master.
	This model promotes a clear separation of work, facilitates collaboration, and allows for releases and hotfixes to be managed more effectively.

	GitHub Flow:
	GitHub Flow is a simpler and more lightweight branching model, often suitable for smaller teams or projects with a faster release cycle.
	It revolves around a single main branch, typically master:
	Development Workflow:
	Create a feature branch: Developers create a new branch for each new feature or bug fix.
	Make changes and commit: Developers make changes within their feature branch and commit their work as they progress.
	Open a pull request: When ready, developers open a pull request to propose their changes for review and merging.
	Review and merge: Team members review the code, provide feedback, and, once approved, merge the changes into the master branch.
	Deploy: After the changes are merged, they can be deployed to the production environment.
	GitHub Flow emphasizes continuous integration, frequent releases, and a collaborative review process.

	The Forking Workflow:
	The Forking Workflow is commonly used in open-source projects where contributors do not have direct write access to the main repository. It involves the following steps:
	Fork: Each contributor creates a personal fork of the main repository.
	Clone: Contributors clone their forked repository to their local machine.
	Branch and commit: Developers create a new branch in their forked repository, make changes, and commit them.
	Push and create a pull request: Developers push their branch to their forked repository and create a pull request to propose changes to the main repository.
	Review and merge: Maintainers or designated reviewers review the changes, provide feedback, and merge the pull request if approved.
	Sync: Contributors regularly sync their forked repository with the main repository to incorporate any new changes.
	The Forking Workflow allows for a high level of contribution while maintaining a structured and controlled approach to merging changes into the main repository.

	Each branching model has its own strengths and is suited to different development scenarios.
	It's important to choose a model that aligns with the needs and characteristics of your project and team.
