  Qusetion: What is version control and why do you need it?

  Answer:
	Version control is a system that manages changes to files and documents over time.
  It tracks modifications made to files, allowing users to keep a record of every change, compare different versions,
  and revert back to previous states if needed. It is commonly used in software development but can be applied to any type of file.

The primary purpose of version control is to provide a collaborative and structured approach to managing changes in a project.
Here are some reasons why version control is necessary:

History and Tracking: Version control systems maintain a chronological history of changes made to files. 
Each modification is recorded along with details such as who made the change, when it was made, and why.
This enables developers to understand the evolution of a project, track down issues, and identify the responsible parties.

Collaboration: Version control facilitates collaboration among team members. Multiple individuals can work on the same project simultaneously,
and the system merges their changes together intelligently. It helps avoid conflicts and allows team members to view, review, and comment on each other's work.

Backup and Recovery: Version control acts as a backup mechanism by storing multiple copies of files. If a file is accidentally deleted or corrupted, 
it can be easily recovered from a previous version. This ensures data integrity and provides a safety net against data loss.

Branching and Parallel Development: Version control systems offer branching mechanisms, which allow users to create independent lines of development.
This is particularly useful for experimenting with new features or fixing bugs without disrupting the main codebase.
Developers can work on different branches simultaneously and later merge them back together.

Rollback and Revert: In case a change introduces a bug or causes an issue, version control allows for easy rollback.
It enables developers to revert to a previous version of a file or the entire project, effectively undoing unwanted modifications.

Code Reviews and Quality Assurance: Version control systems often include features for code reviews and quality assurance.
Team members can review each other's code changes, provide feedback, and ensure that changes meet the project's standards and requirements.

Overall, version control provides an organized and efficient way to manage and track changes in files and projects.
It promotes collaboration, facilitates error recovery, and enhances the overall quality and reliability of software development and other collaborative endeavors.
