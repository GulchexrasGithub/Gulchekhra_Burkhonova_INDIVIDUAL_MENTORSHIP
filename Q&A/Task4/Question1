Question Main goal of unit testing.
Answer:
	 The main goal of unit testing is to verify the correctness of individual units of code,
	 typically at the function or method level. It involves writing automated tests to ensure
	 that each unit of code performs as expected and produces the correct output for a given input.

	Here are the main goals and benefits of unit testing:

	Detecting bugs early: Unit tests allow you to catch bugs and issues early in the development process. 
	By testing individual units of code in isolation, you can identify and fix problems before they propagate to other parts of the system.

	Ensuring code correctness: Unit tests provide a safety net to ensure that each unit of code behaves correctly according to its specification. 
	By defining expected inputs and comparing them with the actual outputs, you can verify that the code produces the desired results.

	Improving code quality: Unit testing encourages writing modular, reusable, and loosely coupled code. 
	It promotes good programming practices such as writing small, focused functions and adhering to the single responsibility principle.

	Facilitating code maintenance: Unit tests act as documentation for the behavior of the code. When making changes or refactoring code,
	you can run the unit tests to ensure that the modifications didn't introduce regressions or break existing functionality.

	Enabling easier collaboration: Unit tests make it easier for multiple developers to work on a codebase simultaneously. 
	They provide a common understanding of how the code should behave and allow developers to make changes with confidence,
	knowing that they won't inadvertently introduce issues.

	Supporting code refactoring: Unit tests act as a safety net when refactoring code.
	They provide assurance that the behavior of the code remains intact after refactoring, 
	helping to catch any unintended side effects.

	Promoting scalability and maintainability: Well-tested codebases are easier to scale and maintain over time. 
	Unit tests make it easier to identify and isolate issues, which reduces the time and effort required for bug fixing and maintenance.

	In summary, unit testing plays a crucial role in ensuring code quality, detecting bugs early, and facilitating code maintenance and collaboration.
	By writing thorough and reliable unit tests, developers can have confidence in the correctness and robustness of their code.
