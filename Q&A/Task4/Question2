Question: Test methods naming.
ANSWER:
	Test method naming is an essential aspect of unit testing.
	Clear and descriptive test method names make it easier to understand the purpose and functionality of each test.
	Here are some guidelines for naming test methods:

Use descriptive names: Choose names that clearly indicate the behavior being tested. 
The name should describe the expected outcome or the specific scenario being tested.

Follow the convention: It is common to prefix test method names with "Test" or use a naming convention that reflects the method being tested.
For example, if you are testing a method called CalculateTotalPrice(), the corresponding test method could be named TestCalculateTotalPrice().

Include relevant details: Include any relevant information that helps distinguish between different test cases. 
This can include input values, specific conditions, or expected outcomes. For example, if you are testing a method that calculates the price based on different discounts, 
you can name the test methods accordingly, such as TestCalculatePrice_WithDiscountApplied() and TestCalculatePrice_WithoutDiscountApplied().

Be consistent: Maintain consistency in your test method naming conventions throughout your test suite. This makes it easier to navigate and understand the tests.

Avoid overly long names: While it's important to be descriptive, excessively long test method names can become cumbersome. 
Aim for concise yet informative names that capture the essence of the test.
