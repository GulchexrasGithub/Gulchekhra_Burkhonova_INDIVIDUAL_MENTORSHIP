Question: About Agile, SCRUM
Answer:
	Agile and Scrum are frameworks used in software development and project management
	to enable iterative and flexible approaches to deliver value in a collaborative manner.
	Here's an overview of Agile and Scrum:

		Agile:
		Agile is an overarching philosophy or mindset that emphasizes adaptability, collaboration,
		and continuous improvement. It values responding to change over following a rigid plan and focuses on delivering value to customers
		through iterative development cycles. Agile promotes self-organizing, cross-functional teams that collaborate closely with stakeholders to deliver high-quality software.

		Key principles of Agile include:

		Customer collaboration over contract negotiation: Encouraging ongoing involvement and feedback from customers to ensure their needs are met.

		Individuals and interactions over processes and tools: Prioritizing effective communication and collaboration within the team.

		Working software over comprehensive documentation: Valuing tangible results and delivering functional software over extensive documentation.

	Responding to change over following a plan: Embracing change and adjusting plans and priorities based on customer feedback and evolving requirements.

		Scrum:
		Scrum is an Agile framework that provides a specific structure and set of practices
		to implement Agile principles. It defines roles, events, artifacts, and rules to facilitate collaboration,
		transparency, and effective project management.

		Key elements of Scrum include:

		Scrum Team: A self-organizing cross-functional team consisting of a Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team.

		Product Backlog: A prioritized list of features, user stories, or requirements representing the work to be done.

		Sprints: Time-boxed iterations (usually 1-4 weeks) during which the team focuses on delivering a potentially releasable increment of the product.

		Sprint Planning: A meeting where the team selects items from the Product Backlog and defines the work to be done in the upcoming Sprint.

		Daily Scrum: A brief daily meeting for the team to synchronize their work, discuss progress, and plan the day ahead.

		Sprint Review: A meeting at the end of each Sprint to review and demonstrate the work completed and gather feedback from stakeholders.

		Sprint Retrospective: A meeting where the team reflects on the previous Sprint and identifies areas for improvement.

		Scrum provides a framework for iterative development, continuous feedback, and adaptation. It promotes transparency, teamwork, and delivering value incrementally.

		Scrum is widely used in software development but can also be applied to various other projects where an Agile approach is beneficial.

	It's worth noting that Agile and Scrum are not synonymous. Agile is a broader mindset, while Scrum is a specific framework
	within the Agile approach. Other Agile frameworks, such as Kanban, Lean, and XP (Extreme Programming), also exist, each with its own principles and practices.
